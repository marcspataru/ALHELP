h1 Section 1 - Variables
p So far we have been making statements about individual objects:
.border.border-dark.p-3
  p
    i Five is less than ten
  p
    i This pie is not as bad as it looks
p Often need to say more:
.border.border-dark.p-3
  p
    i All natural numbers are at least 0
  p
    i All natural numbers are less than ten
  p
    i Some natural numbers are even
  p
    i Some fruit pies are not as bad as they look
p We could try to specify an instance:
.border.border-dark.p-3
  p 
    i Some natural numbers are even
  p
    i Eight is even
p But what if we do not have an instance?
p
  strong We could try to use Boolean operators:
p All natural numbers are less than ten
p (0 < 10) &#8743; (1 < 10) &#8743; (2 < 10) &#8743; (3 < 10) &#8743; ...
p But we cannot have an infinite conjunction/disjunction!

p
  | A 
  i predicate 
  | is a sentence with variables, which becomes true or false when values are substituted for variables
p For each variable, its values are taken from a particular set (the variableâ€™s range)
p We always assume the range is nonempty
p
  i Examples:
.border.border-dark.p-3
  p x < 10 (x in &#8469;)
  p "Pie p is not as bad as it looks" (p in Pies)
  p Both can be true or false, depending on the value of x, p
p A predicate can have more than one variable
p
  i Examples:
.border.border-dark.p-3
  p x < y (x, y in &#8469;)
  p "Pie p is better than pie q" (p, q in Pies)
p A predicate with no variables is an ordinary statement
p
  i Examples:
.border.border-dark.p-3
  p 5 < 10
  p "This apple-and-cranberry pie is better than that cabbage-and-leek pie"
